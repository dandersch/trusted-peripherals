# All config options relating to TFM (usually meaning these options get passed to the tf-m build system)

# For what these options do, see

#
# Zephyr doesnâ€™t cover every CMake argument supported by the TF-M build system.
# The TFM_CMAKE_OPTIONS property on the zephyr_property_target can be used to
# pass custom CMake arguments to the TF-M build system.
#
# To pass -DFOO=bar to the TF-M build system, place the following in your CMakeLists.txt
#
#   set_property(TARGET zephyr_property_target
#                APPEND PROPERTY TFM_CMAKE_OPTIONS
#                -DFOO=bar
