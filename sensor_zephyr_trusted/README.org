- This application is using a custom tf-m secure partition containing services
  that can be called from the non-secure Zephyr side.
- This is a proof-of-work of a trusted peripheral.
- Right now, the secure side contains code to send a measuring request (MR) to our I2C device
  using STM32 HAL code. Most of the STM32 HAL is included inside tf-m, except
  some of the i2c code - that needs to be included by hand (TODO how to).
- The Zephyr side sends a data fetch (DF) command to the device using zephyr's
  i2c api to get the temperature and prints it.
- We are forcing the test flash memory layout memory from tf-m to get more
  flash memory for our ns app (from 32kb to 172kb). By default - even with just
  enabling CONFIG_SHELL=y and nothing else- we get an error of the sort:
  ~region `FLASH' overflowed by 12324 bytes~.
